Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2549 - The register "XLXI_1" has the property IOB=TRUE, but was not
   packed into the OLOGIC component. The output signal for register symbol
   XLXI_1 requires general routing to fabric, but the register can only be
   routed to ILOGIC, IODELAY, and IOB.

   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   2,860    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            1
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             1 out of       1  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       1    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       1    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  11,440    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
